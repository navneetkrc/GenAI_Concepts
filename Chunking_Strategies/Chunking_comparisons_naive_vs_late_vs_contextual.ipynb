        "In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), effectively embedding documents for retrieval is critical to maintaining semantic accuracy. Traditional chunking methods often fragment the broader context of a document, leading to retrieval failures and reduced relevance. To address this, two advanced strategies—**Late Chunking** and **Contextual Retrieval**—have emerged, each with unique approaches to preserving document context.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Late Chunking** embeds the entire document first, ensuring that chunk embeddings retain global context before splitting. This method is efficient and works well within the context window of embedding models.\n",
        "- **Contextual Retrieval**, on the other hand, enriches individual chunks by adding context summaries generated by large language models (LLMs). This approach is particularly effective for long documents that exceed model context windows, enabling more nuanced and accurate retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both methods aim to mitigate the semantic loss inherent in naive chunking, with Late Chunking excelling in speed and simplicity, while Contextual Retrieval offers enhanced accuracy for complex queries. This notebook will explore these strategies through code implementations and their practical applications in RAG systems.\n",

        "**You are absolutely right to question that! Seeing all \"Late Chunking\" points collapse into one single spot *does* seem counter-intuitive compared to Naive or Contextual chunking, where each chunk gets its own distinct location (or nearly distinct for Contextual).**\n",
        "\n",
        "However, it's **correct *according to the specific, simplified implementation* of `late_chunking` used in the provided code.** It's not necessarily representative of all possible \"late chunking\" strategies, but it reflects how *this particular function* works.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the breakdown of why it happens in this code:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Single Embedding Calculation:**\n",
        "    *   The `late_chunking` function first takes a large initial portion of the document (up to the model's limit, potentially truncated).\n",
        "    *   It then calls `embedding_model.encode()` **only once** on this large chunk to get *one single* high-dimensional embedding vector (`document_embedding`). This vector represents the semantic meaning of that initial large piece of text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Text Chunking:**\n",
        "    *   *After* calculating that single embedding, the function splits the *original document text* into smaller chunks based on the `chunk_size`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Identical Embedding Assignment:**\n",
        "    *   The crucial step: For *every single one* of the smaller text chunks generated, the function assigns the **exact same** `document_embedding` vector calculated in step 1.\n",
        "    *   So, in the `all_results` list, you have multiple entries with `strategy: 'Late'`, each with a different `'text'` field, but they all share the *identical* `'embedding'` field (pointing to the same numpy array in memory).\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **PCA Projection:**\n",
        "    *   PCA takes all the embedding vectors (from Naive, Contextual, Late, Query, Doc Ref) as input.\n",
        "    *   When PCA encounters multiple input vectors that are *identical* in the high-dimensional space (like all the 'Late' embeddings), it mathematically *must* project them to the **exact same point** in the lower-dimensional (2D) space.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this approach might be used (Simplified Concept):**\n",
        "\n",
        "The *idea* behind this simplified late chunking is that the embedding derived from the larger initial context (the `document_embedding`) captures the main theme or global context better than tiny individual chunks would. By assigning this \"global context\" embedding to all chunks, the hope is that even small chunks become searchable based on the overall document theme.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why it feels \"incorrect\" and limitations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Loss of Granularity:** You lose the specific semantic meaning of each individual small chunk. A chunk about \"Battery Drain\" and a chunk about \"Camera Problems\" end up with the exact same representation, making it impossible to distinguish them based solely on their embedding in this scheme.\n",
        "*   **Not True \"Chunk\" Embeddings:** It's slightly misleading terminology. You have chunk *texts*, but they are all associated with a *document-level* (or large-segment-level) embedding.\n",
        "*   **More Sophisticated Late Chunking:** More advanced late chunking techniques might embed *overlapping* larger windows and assign the embedding of the larger window to the chunk that falls within it, or use other methods. This *would* likely result in slightly different embeddings for different chunks (creating a cluster, not a single point) while still incorporating broader context than naive chunking.\n",
        "\n",
        "**In Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The visualization is correctly reflecting the output of the provided `late_chunking` function. The function itself implements a very specific, simplified version of the late chunking concept where one embedding is reused for all chunks. This leads to the observed collapse into a single point in the PCA plot. It highlights a trade-off: potential capture of global context at the cost of losing local, chunk-specific semantic detail in the embedding itself."

        "### Interpreting the Visualization:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Proximity to Query:** Observe which strategy's chunks (dots of a specific color) cluster closest to the Query marker (black star). Chunks closer in the embedding space are generally considered more semantically similar by the model. This suggests which strategy might yield more relevant results for this specific query.\n",
        "2.  **Cluster Cohesion:** Look at how tightly clustered the chunks are for each strategy.\n",
        "    *   **Naive:** Often shows more scatter, as each chunk's embedding is independent.\n",
        "    *   **Late:** Chunks will overlap perfectly in this *simplified* implementation because they share the exact same embedding. More advanced late chunking would show clusters around different larger segment embeddings.\n",
        "    *   **Contextual:** May show tighter clustering than Naive if the added summary successfully pulls related chunks together, or could shift chunks based on the summary's influence.\n",
        "3.  **Relation to Document Reference:** Compare the chunk clusters to the Document Reference marker (purple diamond). This shows how well individual chunks represent the overall document's semantic meaning according to the embedding model. Late chunking (in this simplified form) forces all chunks to this point. Naive and Contextual chunks might be closer or further depending on their specific content.\n",
        "4.  **Outliers:** Identify any chunks that are far away from their strategy's main cluster or the query. These might represent less relevant parts of the document or areas where the chunking strategy struggled.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations:**\n",
        "*   **PCA Projection:** PCA reduces high-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 384 dimensions for MiniLM) to 2D, inevitably losing some information. Distances in the 2D plot are approximations.\n",
        "*   **Simplified Late Chunking:** The implementation here uses one embedding for the whole (truncated) document. True late chunking often involves more complex strategies like embedding overlapping larger windows.\n",
        "*   **Single Document/Query:** This visualization is based on one document and one query. Results can vary significantly with different content and queries.\n",
        "*   **Model Dependence:** The results heavily depend on the chosen embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and summarizer (`bart-large-cnn`).\n",

        "### Interpreting the Visualization (Updated for Token Pooling Late Chunking):\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Proximity to Query:** Observe which strategy's chunks (dots of a specific color) cluster closest to the Query marker (black star). Chunks closer in the embedding space are generally considered more semantically similar by the model. Contextual (Red) might often be closest if the LLM summary was effective. Late (Green) might be closer than Naive (Blue) if the query relates to the overall document context captured during token embedding.\n",
        "2.  **Cluster Cohesion and Location:** Look at how tightly clustered the chunks are for each strategy and where the clusters are located relative to the Document Reference (purple diamond).\n",
        "    *   **Naive (Blue):** Often shows the most scatter, as each chunk's embedding is independent and lacks broader context. Might be located far from the Document Reference if chunks are very specific.\n",
        "    *   **Late (Green - Token Pooling):** Should now form a cluster (not a single point). This cluster represents chunks whose embeddings were derived from context-aware tokens. It's expected to be somewhat close to the Document Reference (as tokens were aware of the full doc) but should show more spread than the previous single-point implementation, reflecting the specific content of each chunk. The tightness might depend on the document's topic consistency.\n",
        "    *   **Contextual (Red):** May show tighter clustering than Naive if the added LLM summary successfully pulls related chunks together. Its location might be shifted compared to Naive/Late based on the summary's influence, potentially closer to the Query if the summary is relevant.\n",
        "3.  **Relation to Document Reference:** Compare the chunk clusters to the Document Reference marker (purple diamond). This marker represents the standard pooled embedding of the (truncated) document.\n",
        "    *   The **Late** cluster's proximity to this point indicates how well the average of context-aware tokens for specific chunks aligns with the overall pooled representation.\n",
        "    *   **Naive** chunks might be further away.\n",
        "    *   **Contextual** chunks' position relative to the Doc Ref depends heavily on the generated summary.\n",
        "4.  **Outliers:** Identify any chunks that are far away from their strategy's main cluster or the query. These might represent unique sub-topics or areas where a strategy struggled.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Differences with this Implementation:**\n",
        "*   **Late Chunking is now a cluster:** It reflects chunk-specific content derived from context-aware token embeddings, matching the methodology in the reference PDF more closely. It is *not* expected to be a single point anymore.\n",
        "*   **Model Dependence:** Results still depend heavily on the embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), its ability to provide meaningful token embeddings, and the summarizer. Some embedding models might perform better or worse at token-level tasks.\n",
        "*   **Complexity:** This Late Chunking method is computationally more involved than the previous simplified version or Naive chunking, as it requires obtaining and processing token-level embeddings. Potentially requires more GPU memory.\n",
        "*   **Potential Issues:** Token-level late chunking can be sensitive to the `chunk_size` aligning well with token boundaries and the model's `max_seq_length`. Very long documents might still face challenges if they significantly exceed the model's context window even for tokenization."

        "\n",
        "1.  **Proximity to Query:** Observe which strategy's chunks (dots of a specific color) cluster closest to the Query marker (black star). With Nomic, known for good retrieval performance, the relative positions might differ from MiniLM. Assess if Contextual (Red) or Late (Green) chunks are generally nearer to the query for this specific example.\n",
        "2.  **Cluster Cohesion and Location:**\n",
        "    *   **Naive (Blue):** Still expected to show significant scatter, reflecting its lack of broader context.\n",
        "    *   **Late (Green - Token Pooling with Nomic):** Should now form a potentially tighter cluster than Naive. Since Nomic processed a much longer context (up to 8192 tokens) to generate the token embeddings, this cluster represents chunks aware of nearly the entire document. Its position relative to the Document Reference (Purple Diamond) will be interesting – it might be close if the pooled token embeddings align well with the overall pooled document embedding, or it might shift based on the specifics of Nomic's token representations. Expect a clear cluster, not a single point.\n",
        "    *   **Contextual (Red):** Similar logic applies – clustering depends on the LLM summary. Compare its location and spread to both Naive and Late.\n",
        "3.  **Relation to Document Reference:** The Document Reference (Purple Diamond) represents the standard pooled embedding of the *entire* document using Nomic. Compare the centers of the Naive, Late, and Contextual clusters to this point. Late chunking, having processed most/all of the document's tokens, might conceptually be closer than Naive, but the pooling mechanism differs, so empirical results matter.\n",
        "4.  **Outliers:** As before, look for points far from their respective clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Considerations with Nomic:**\n",
        "*   **Longer Context:** The key difference is that the Late Chunking embeddings (Green) are now derived from token embeddings that were calculated with awareness of a much larger context (potentially the whole document if < 8192 tokens). This should, theoretically, make them more robust than the severely truncated MiniLM version.\n",
        "*   **Computational Cost:** Generating token embeddings for 8192 tokens is significantly more computationally intensive (time and memory, especially GPU memory) than for 256/512 tokens or doing simple naive chunk embedding.\n",
        "*   **Model Characteristics:** Nomic has different training data and architectural nuances than MiniLM, so the resulting embedding space and relationships between points will differ.\n",
        "*   **`trust_remote_code=True`:** Remember this was necessary for loading the model."
