### Question 1: How to increase accuracy, and reliability & make answers verifiable in LLM?

*   **Answer Summary:** Improving these requires a multi-faceted approach:
    *   **Data:** High-quality pre-training and fine-tuning data (accurate, diverse, vetted).
    *   **Training/Fine-tuning:** Instruction tuning, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)/Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), domain adaptation.
    *   **Inference:** Advanced prompt engineering (CoT, self-critique), controlled decoding (low temperature), self-consistency.
    *   **External Systems:** **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for grounding in external knowledge and enabling citations (key for verifiability), fact-checking modules, tool use.
    *   **Evaluation:** Robust metrics, human evaluation, red teaming, continuous monitoring.

### Question 2: How does RAG work?

*   **Answer Summary:** RAG combines retrieval systems with generative LLMs.
    *   **Workflow:**
        1.  User query is received.
        2.  **Retrieval:** Query is embedded -> Semantic search against an indexed knowledge corpus (vector database of document chunk embeddings) -> Top-k relevant chunks retrieved.
        3.  **Augmentation:** Retrieved chunks (context) are combined with the original query into an augmented prompt for the LLM.
        4.  **Generation:** LLM generates an answer based on the augmented prompt (grounded in the provided context).
        5.  (Optional) Citations to source documents are provided.
    *   **Benefits Addressed:** Knowledge cutoff, hallucinations, lack of specific/proprietary knowledge, verifiability.
    *   **Components:** Retriever (Embedding Model, Vector DB, Knowledge Corpus), Generator (LLM), Orchestrator.

### Question 3: What are some benefits of using the RAG system?

*   **Answer Summary:** Key benefits include:
    *   **Improved Accuracy / Reduced Hallucinations:** Grounding answers in retrieved facts.
    *   **Access to Up-to-Date Information:** Knowledge base can be updated easily.
    *   **Domain-Specific / Proprietary Knowledge Integration:** Use internal data without full retraining.
    *   **Enhanced Verifiability / Trust:** Ability to cite sources.
    *   **Cost-Effective Knowledge Updates:** Cheaper than retraining/fine-tuning.
    *   **Increased Specificity / Relevance:** Answers tailored by retrieved context.
    *   **Controlled Information Sources:** Curate the knowledge base.
    *   **Potential for Personalization:** Retrieve user-specific context.

### Question 4: When should I use Fine-tuning instead of RAG?

*   **Answer Summary:** Prioritize **Fine-tuning** when the goal is to:
    *   **Teach New Skills/Styles/Formats:** Change *how* the model behaves (persona, output structure, specific reasoning process), not just *what* it knows.
    *   **Improve on Implicit Knowledge Tasks:** Handle tasks where knowledge isn't easily captured in retrievable documents (subtle classification, domain-specific reasoning patterns).
    *   **Internalize Stable Knowledge:** Embed knowledge that doesn't change frequently, potentially for lower latency.
    *   **Minimize Inference Latency:** If the retrieval step in RAG is too slow and knowledge is stable.
    *   **Source Citation is Not Required:** When the focus is solely on the response quality/style.
*   **Key Distinction:** RAG for injecting external, dynamic facts; Fine-tuning for changing inherent behavior/style/skills.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Fine-tune for style/skill, then use RAG for facts (often the best solution).

### Question 5: What are the architecture patterns for customizing LLM with proprietary data?

*   **Answer Summary:** Common patterns include:
    *   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Retrieve context at inference. Good for dynamic knowledge, verifiability, data security (data used as context, not training). Often the best starting point.
    *   **Fine-tuning (Full or PEFT):** Adapt model weights with proprietary examples. Better for style/skill adaptation, implicit patterns, stable knowledge. PEFT (LoRA, etc.) is preferred for efficiency and reduced catastrophic forgetting. Security risk if data leaves secure environment for training.
    *   **Continued Pre-training:** Further pre-training on large domain corpus. Deep domain adaptation but very costly.
    *   **Hybrid (Fine-tuning + RAG):** Combine both for style/skill adaptation + dynamic factual grounding. Complex but powerful.
    *   **Tool Use / Agents:** LLM calls external APIs/functions that access proprietary data/systems. Good for real-time structured data access and performing actions. Requires robust API design and LLM reliability for tool selection.

### Question 6: What are the best practices for fine-tuning LLMs with proprietary data?

*   **Answer Summary:** Best practices emphasize careful planning, data quality, and security:
    *   **Strategy:** Define clear goals, evaluate alternatives (RAG, prompting).
    *   **Data Preparation:** **Quality over quantity**, relevance, consistency (prompt/completion pairs), cleaning, PII removal/anonymization, representativeness, create a hold-out set.
    *   **Security/Compliance:** Use secure infrastructure (VPC/on-prem), strict access controls, data minimization, adhere to regulations (GDPR, etc.).
    *   **Model/Method Selection:** Choose appropriate base model, strongly prefer **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** over full fine-tuning.
    *   **Training Process:** Use experiment tracking, tune hyperparameters, monitor loss, checkpoint regularly.
    *   **Evaluation:** Use hold-out set, task-specific metrics, **human evaluation** for nuance, compare against baselines (base model, RAG), check for regressions.
    *   **Deployment/Iteration:** Secure deployment, continuous monitoring, iterative improvement.

### Question 7: What are the most effective anonymization techniques for LLMs?

*   **Answer Summary:** Perfect anonymization is hard; goal is risk reduction. Techniques include:
    *   **Named Entity Recognition (NER) + Redaction/Replacement:** Identify PII (names, addresses, SSNs) using NER, then replace with placeholders (`[NAME]`) or fake data (pseudonymization). Effectiveness depends heavily on NER quality. Replacement preferred over redaction for LLM utility.
    *   **Rule-Based Filtering:** Use regex/keywords for specific patterns (phone numbers, emails). Brittle but simple for known formats.
    *   **Data Masking/Generalization:** Reduce specificity (e.g., age -> age range, exact location -> region). Reduces utility.
    *   **Synthetic Data Generation:** Train a model to generate artificial data resembling the original. Complex, potential for leakage from the generator model itself.
    *   **Differential Privacy (DP):** Add mathematical noise for formal privacy guarantees. Difficult to apply effectively to LLMs without harming utility significantly.
    *   **Best Practices:** Use a layered approach (NER + rules), tailor to use case/risk, focus on NER quality, secure pseudonym maps, use input/output filters, evaluate effectiveness, consider secure environments.
