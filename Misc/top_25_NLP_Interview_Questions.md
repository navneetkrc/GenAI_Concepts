## üîπ Core Concepts

### ‚úÖ What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

NLP is a field of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret, generate, and interact using human language.
It combines **linguistics** and **machine learning** to process text or speech data.

---

### ‚úÖ What is the difference between NLP and NLU (Natural Language Understanding)?

| **Aspect**  | **NLP**                              | **NLU**                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Goal**    | General text processing              | Understanding meaning & intent       |
| **Scope**   | Includes NLU, NLG, and preprocessing | Subset of NLP                        |
| **Example** | Tokenization, POS tagging            | Intent detection, sentiment analysis |

**üîÅ Note:** NLU focuses on meaning and semantics within NLP.

---

### ‚úÖ What is tokenization and why is it important?

Tokenization splits text into smaller units called **tokens** (words, subwords, characters).
It's the **first step** in most NLP pipelines, making raw text processable for models.

---

### ‚úÖ What are stop words, and should we always remove them?

Stop words are common words like *"the"*, *"is"*, *"in"* that often carry little semantic value.
**Should we remove them?**

‚úî Often removed to reduce noise and improve efficiency.
‚ö† But retained for tasks like translation or question answering where every word matters.

---

### ‚úÖ Explain stemming vs lemmatization with examples.

| **Feature** | **Stemming**          | **Lemmatization**      |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Method**  | Rule-based chopping   | Dictionary + POS-aware |
| **Output**  | Not always real words | Real base words        |
| **Example** | `"running"` ‚Üí `runn`  | `"running"` ‚Üí `run`    |

üß† *Stemming is faster but less accurate; lemmatization gives better linguistic correctness.*

---

## üîπ Embeddings & Representations

### ‚úÖ What are word embeddings? How do they work?

**Short Answer:**
Word embeddings are dense vector representations capturing word meanings via context and relationships.

**Detailed Explanation:**
They map words to fixed-size vectors where similar meanings have similar vectors.
Learned from large corpora by models like **Word2Vec** or **GloVe**, they capture semantic relationships beyond simple one-hot encoding.

---

### ‚úÖ How do Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText differ?

| **Model**    | **Key Idea**                                                               |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Word2Vec** | Predicts words using local context (Skip-gram/CBOW)                        |
| **GloVe**    | Builds word vectors from global co-occurrence statistics                   |
| **FastText** | Uses subword n-grams to represent words, handling rare/unseen words better |

**Infographic Suggestion:**
Illustrate three pipelines showing Word2Vec (local window), GloVe (corpus-wide matrix), and FastText (subword composition).

---

### ‚úÖ What is the Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problem and how can it be handled?

**OOV:** When a word wasn't seen during training, making it impossible to generate its embedding.

**Solutions:**
‚úî FastText's subword n-grams compose unseen words.
‚úî Contextual models (e.g., **BERT**) generate dynamic embeddings based on sentence context.
‚úî `<UNK>` token for unknown words in simpler models.

---

### ‚úÖ What are sentence and document embeddings? How do they differ from word embeddings?

| **Level**             | **Representation**                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Word**              | Individual word vectors                              |
| **Sentence/Document** | Vector summarizing full sentence or document meaning |

**Methods:**
‚úî Averaging word embeddings (basic)
‚úî Pretrained models like **Sentence-BERT**, **Universal Sentence Encoder**

**Use Cases:** Classification, Semantic Search, Clustering.

---

### ‚úÖ Explain static vs contextual word embeddings.

| **Aspect**     | **Static**                | **Contextual**                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Definition** | One fixed vector per word | Vectors vary based on sentence context  |
| **Examples**   | Word2Vec, GloVe           | BERT, RoBERTa                           |
| **Limitation** | Cannot resolve ambiguity  | Handles polysemy, captures true meaning |

---

## üîπ Attention & Transformers

### ‚úÖ What is the attention mechanism? How does it work?

**Short Answer:**
Attention allows models to focus on relevant input parts during predictions.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Convert tokens to **Queries (Q)**, **Keys (K)**, **Values (V)**

2. Compute attention weights:

   $$
   \text{Attention} = \text{softmax} \left( \frac{Q \cdot K^T}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right)
   $$

3. Output: Weighted sum of **V** emphasizing important tokens.

**Infographic Suggestion:** Visual showing token interactions with varying attention weights.

| **Type**            | **Description**                                         | **Use Case**                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Self-attention**  | Tokens attend to others in the same sequence            | Captures intra-sequence relationships |
| **Cross-attention** | One sequence attends to another (e.g., encoder-decoder) | Translation, Summarization            |

---

### ‚úÖ What are Transformers and why are they important in NLP?

**Short Answer:**
Transformers use self-attention to model long-range dependencies efficiently.

**Key Features:**

Adapting pretrained models to downstream tasks:

**Steps:**
‚úî Add task-specific layers (e.g., classifier, QA head)
‚úî Train on labeled task data
‚úî Benefits: Few labeled examples required, leverages pretrained knowledge

---

## üîπ Evaluation & Applications

### ‚úÖ What is BLEU score?

Measures machine translation quality via n-gram overlap:

$$
\text{BLEU} = \text{Brevity Penalty} \times \text{Geometric Mean of n-gram Precisions}
$$

**Range:** 0 to 1 (higher = better)
‚ö† Limitation: Focuses on surface overlap, may miss true semantic quality.

---

### ‚úÖ What is perplexity?

Quantifies model's uncertainty:

$$
\text{Perplexity} = 2^{-\text{average log probability of tokens}}
$$

Lower perplexity = better predictions (used in evaluating generative models).

---

### ‚úÖ NER and POS Tagging

| **Task**        | **Function**                        | **Example**                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **NER**         | Detects entities (names, locations) | `"Barack Obama"` ‚Üí PERSON        |
| **POS Tagging** | Labels grammatical roles            | `"fox"` ‚Üí NOUN, `"jumps"` ‚Üí VERB |

Essential for syntactic and semantic understanding.
