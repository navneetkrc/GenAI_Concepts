**Post-training** is a stage where a pre-trained language model is further refined using curated, often instruction-focused, data to improve its ability to follow user directions and specific behaviors.

### Pre-training
- Starts with a **randomly initialized model** trained on broad data from sources like Wikipedia, Common Crawl, and GitHub.
- Produces a **base model** that predicts the next word/token but is not specialized for instructions or tasks.

### Instruction/Chat Model (Post-training)
- Uses post-training to learn from curated Q&A or instruction datasets.
- Results in a model that can respond to prompts, e.g., answering questions accurately.

### Continual Post-training & Customization
- (Continual) post-training is used to further adapt the model to new data, tasks, or changes, enhancing its capabilities or altering behaviors.
- Produces a **customized model** specialized for specific domains or tasks (e.g., SQL generation).

### Key Takeaways
- **Pre-training:** Broad, general knowledge learning.
- **Post-training:** Targeted fine-tuning for following instructions.
- **Customization:** Specialization for domains, tasks, or behaviors.

These steps enable LLMs to progress from generic language understanding to domain-specialized assistants through sequential training and fine-tuning.

# 🧠 Methods Used During LLM Training

---

## 🔹 Pre-Training (Unsupervised Learning)

📚 **Data** → Wikipedia, Common Crawl, GitHub (unlabeled)
🔄 **Process** → Predict next word (*“I like cats”*)
📏 **Objective** →

$$
\min_{\pi} -\log \pi(I) - \log \pi(\text{like} \mid I) - \log \pi(\text{cats} \mid I\, \text{like})
$$

⚡ **Scale** → $>>2T$ tokens
✅ **Result** → Broad **language understanding**, not task-specific

➡️ **Flow**: 📚 Data → 🔄 Prediction → 📏 Loss Minimization → ✅ General LLM

---

## 🔹 Post-training Method 1: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)

🎯 **Data** → Labeled prompt–response pairs

> Prompt: *“Explain LLM to me”*
> Response: *“LLM is …”*

🔄 **Process** → Model learns correct responses
📏 **Objective** →

$$
\min_{\pi} -\log \pi(\text{Response} \mid \text{Prompt})
$$

⚡ **Scale** → \~1K–1B tokens
✅ **Result** → Better **instruction following & relevance**

➡️ **Flow**: 🎯 Labeled Data → 🔄 Response Imitation → 📏 Loss Minimization → ✅ Instruction Follower
