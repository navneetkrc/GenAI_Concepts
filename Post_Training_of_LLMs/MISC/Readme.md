## Direct Comparison Table

| Method | Core Idea | Reward Signal | RL Required? | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|--------|-----------|--------------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **SFT** | Supervised imitation of data | Human labels | ❌ | Simple, fast, stable, strong for well-covered tasks | Lacks fine-grained alignment, can’t optimize subtle preferences |

## Flow Diagrams and Descriptions

### SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)

**Flow:**
1. Pre-trained LLM ➔
2. Curated, labeled (input, output) pairs ➔
3. Minimize cross-entropy loss on these pairs ➔
4. Model imitates gold responses

**Key Example:** Train model to answer questions with polite, helpful tone using labeled chat transcripts.

[5]

***

### RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) with PPO

**Flow:**
1. SFT Model ➔
2. Generate multiple responses for prompts ➔
3. Human labelers rank response quality ➔
4. Train Reward Model on labeled pairs ➔
5. Generate outputs, score them with Reward Model ➔
6. Update LLM policy using RL (typically PPO) to maximize expected reward

**Key Example:** Align model to avoid harmful outputs by having humans mark unsafe answers as low preference, so RM penalizes them and PPO optimizes model away from those behaviors.

[2][4][5]

***

### DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)

**Flow:**
1. SFT Model ➔
2. Collect preference pairs (A or B better?) ➔
3. Directly optimize model with a binary cross-entropy loss to boost probabilities of preferred over rejected answers.
4. No explicit reward model or RL loop.

**Key Example:** Train model to pick factually accurate answers in trivia by presenting pairs (one true, one false), optimize directly so true answers become more probable.

[5]

***

### PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) in RLHF

**Flow:**
1. Policy model outputs responses ➔
2. Reward Model scores each response ➔
3. Critic estimates value for stability ➔
4. PPO updates policy with clipped objective to prevent destabilizing jumps and keep policy near initialization (KL-penalty)

**Key Mechanism:** Designed for RLHF, ensures model doesn’t drift far from SFT policy while aligning to preferences.

[3][4][6]

***

### GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)

**Flow:**
1. For each prompt, sample group of N responses ➔
2. Reward Model scores each ➔
3. Compute each response’s advantage as deviation from group average (within-batch normalization)
4. Use this as policy gradient for update (no need for explicit critic/value net)

**Key Example:** Efficiently align a code-generation LLM by scoring all possible completions for a coding prompt, updating model to favor those that “generally do better” than batch mean.

[4][1][2]

## Evolution and Motivation—What Each Fixed

- **SFT**: Direct and simple, but can’t address nuanced/subjective preferences or safety gaps that aren’t well-covered in labeled data.
- **RLHF (with PPO)**: Addresses the “alignment gap” by learning a reward model from human preferences and performing RL for goal-oriented optimization, closing the mismatch between imitation and true user need.
- **PPO**: Provides a stable RL backbone for RLHF; uses clipping and KL penalties to prevent large, destabilizing updates in model policy, which could lead to reward hacking or loss of general ability.
- **DPO**: Simplifies post-training by removing the reward model and complex RL loop; directly optimizes the model on human preference pairs with a stable objective, making training cheaper, faster, and more stable while preserving much of RLHF’s alignment benefits.
- **GRPO**: Further simplifies RL by using groupwise normalization of rewards instead of an explicit critic or value model (reducing GPU/memory demand); aligns model by relative intra-group quality, excellent for reasoning heavy, generative tasks.

[1][2][4][5]

## Key Examples Illustrating Evolution

- **SFT falls short** for subtle attributes (helpfulness, avoiding toxicity) if not fully represented in labeled data.
- **RLHF adds** preference scoring, explicitly closing the gap via reward models (example: asking humans to rate outputs for helpfulness, factuality, and safety), directly optimizing those qualities in RL.
- **PPO fixes RL instability** making RLHF as a pipeline feasible for very large models.
- **DPO emerges** as a simpler, more robust fix for the resource and complexity headwinds faced by PPO-based RLHF.
- **GRPO emerges** to handle multi-answer rationality and reduce resource needs, especially for tasks where group context and solution diversity matter (code gen, math, multi-step reasoning).

The key differences and improvements from **SFT to GRPO** reflect a progression from simple imitation learning to ever more efficient, scalable, and precise alignment with human preferences.

## Core Differences and Improvements

### SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
- **Method:** Trains models on human-labeled (input, output) data using standard supervised loss.
- **Limitation:** Cannot optimize subtle or nuanced behaviors beyond the labeled data; alignment and safety are limited by dataset coverage.[1][2]

### RLHF (with PPO)
- **Improvement:** Introduces reinforcement learning based on a reward model trained from human preference data, allowing models to optimize directly for subjective qualities (helpfulness, safety, etc.).
- **Advantage:** Closes the “alignment gap”—actual user goals are encoded in the reward, not just the labeled samples.
- **Limitation:** Computationally expensive, requires separate reward models and complex RL algorithms which can be unstable.[2][3]

### DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)
- **Improvement:** Simplifies post-training by using pairs of human preferences to directly optimize the model via a discriminative (BCE) loss, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model or RL loop.
- **Advantage:** Dramatically reduces training complexity and cost, improves stability, and still achieves most of the alignment benefits of RLHF.[4][1]

### GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)
- **Improvement:** Instead of using a value/critic model, GRPO normalizes rewards within sampled response groups, making RL training for large models more memory and compute efficient.
- **Advantage:** Further lowers hardware demands, avoids explicit critics, and better supports tasks where group-level comparison is natural, such as code generation or multi-answer reasoning.[5][2]

## Progression Highlights

- **SFT:** Simple, supervised, fast—but limited alignment
- **RLHF (PPO):** Adds deep alignment via reward models, costly RL
- **DPO:** Removes reward model, direct preference learning, more efficient
- **GRPO:** Removes critic, introduces groupwise normalization, even more efficient and scalable for modern language modeling

Each stage fixes a critical bottleneck in the previous approach—first in alignment flexibility (SFT→RLHF), then in training efficiency and simplicity (RLHF→DPO), and finally in computational scalability (DPO→GRPO).[3][1][2][5]

Here are real-world examples illustrating each training method, showing how each is used in practice across different domains:

## SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)
- **Example:** Training a customer support chatbot with a dataset of actual customer inquiries and high-quality human-written responses. The model learns to map each type of question to an appropriate answer, such as classifying emails ("spam" vs "not spam") or providing correct answers to product queries.[1][2]
- **Deployment:** Used in content generation tools, chatbots, personalized assistants, and medical diagnosis support systems where explicit, labeled input-output pairs are available.[1]

## RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
- **Example:** Fine-tuning AI models for educational tools where students ask math or coding questions, and human reviewers grade the helpfulness and accuracy of responses. The model learns to generate solutions and explanations more aligned to how humans think and communicate, such as solving math step-by-step or giving code debugging tips.[3][4]
- **Deployment:** Applied in tutoring systems, code assistants, healthcare chatbots, and AI agents required to produce safe, nuanced, or highly contextual output.[3]

## PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) in RLHF
- **Example:** Optimizing a language model to answer factual questions like "What is the capital of France?" If multiple possible answers are provided, human feedback rewards correct answers (e.g., "Paris") so PPO gradually increases the likelihood of giving correct, helpful responses. PPO ensures stable updates and avoids big performance regressions.[5]
- **Deployment:** Used in training models like OpenAI GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, especially for applications needing both accuracy and controlled, stable improvements over time.[5]

## DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)
- **Example:** Improving a model’s factual accuracy in trivia-like settings. Crowd workers are shown pairs of model responses—one factually correct, one incorrect. DPO directly optimizes the model so the probability of producing the preferred (correct) answer increases, without needing a separate reward model or complex RL loop.
- **Deployment:** Useful for aligning LLMs or chatbots to follow human preferences in tasks where binary choices or pairwise comparisons are feasible (e.g., preference in tone, factual reliability, or style).[6]

## GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)
- **Example:** Training a chatbot on creative or open-ended questions by generating several candidate responses to the same prompt (e.g., "What’s the weather today?"). Each response is scored for usefulness or relevance, and the model is updated to favor responses that outperform the group average, streamlining learning without a value network. This is especially effective for complex code generation where relative rankings among group outputs are meaningful.[7][8]
- **Deployment:** Used to reduce RL compute costs in large models and scenarios where groupwise or relative feedback is valuable—such as DeepSeek’s multi-answer AI assistants in code and reasoning-heavy domains.[8][7]

These examples demonstrate how each method brings unique strengths suitable for specific real-world machine learning problems, from highly structured tasks (SFT) to scalable, preference-driven models (GRPO).

**SFT**, **PPO**, and **GRPO** differ significantly in real-world use cases due to their training complexity, feedback requirements, and optimal application domains.

## SFT Real-World Use Cases

- **Customer Support Bots:** SFT is commonly used to train chatbots for structured, repetitive customer queries using large datasets of labeled (question, answer) pairs.[1][2]
- **Document Classification:** Email spam detection, news article categorization, legal document labeling—any well-defined text-to-label task works efficiently with SFT, provided high-quality annotated data is available.[1]
- **Medical and Legal QA:** When gold standard answers are available, SFT can produce models for decision assistance in medicine and law by strictly learning from expert-verified data.[1]

## PPO Real-World Use Cases

- **General-Purpose Conversational Agents:** Large-scale digital assistants (e.g., GPT-3.5/4 Chatbot deployment) are trained with PPO-based RLHF to optimize for human preferences in helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty. Human feedback is used to reward or penalize generated outputs, improving alignment beyond what SFT offers.[3]
- **Content Moderation:** Systems designed to filter out toxic content or hate speech in user-generated platforms use PPO to align generation to safety and ethical guidelines that are poorly captured by explicit labels alone.
- **Education and Tutoring:** Adaptive educational AIs (math, coding, language learning assistants) use PPO to systematically improve feedback quality and personalized responses based on human evaluations of step-by-step solution helpfulness and clarity.[3]

## GRPO Real-World Use Cases

- **Code Generation Systems:** GRPO allows efficient RL fine-tuning of models for code completion or bug-fixing by evaluating sets of candidate answers and updating models to prefer solutions that generally outperform others, without needing a complex value function.[4][5]
- **Multi-Answer Reasoning Tasks:** In tasks like open-ended problem solving or creative writing, GRPO makes models prefer diverse, high-quality solutions by reinforcing outputs that are ranked better among group alternatives for the same prompt.[4]
- **Large-Scale Instruction Models:** DeepSeek and other LLMs use GRPO to scale post-training in reasoning-heavy and resource-constrained settings, achieving strong results where traditional RL or SFT alone is suboptimal.[5][4]

| Training Method | Typical Real-World Use Cases | Key Strength |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| SFT | Customer bots, classification, expert QA | Fast, stable on labeled data |
| PPO | Digital assistants, moderation, adaptive tutors | Deep alignment to human values |
| GRPO | Code gen, open-ended reasoning, group-comparison models | Efficient, scalable RL for complex outputs |

[2][5][3][4][1]

Each method excels where its training paradigm aligns with the cost of annotation, alignment needs, and the complexity or diversity of outputs required in real deployments.
