Hereâ€™s a **well-structured explanation in markdown** covering all the terms and components in the diagram you shared (which depicts how Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback â€” RLHF â€” works, including SFT, reward modeling, GAE, policy/value models, etc.):

---

# âœ… **Explanation of RLHF Architecture Diagram**

The diagram shows the process of fine-tuning a language model using **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**, **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** with reward modeling, and **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)** to improve performance based on user feedback or human preferences.

---

## ðŸ“¦ **Key Components**

### 1. **User Query (x)**

* The input provided by the user.
* Example: a search query, question, or prompt.

---

### 2. **SFT Model (Ï€^SFT)**

* **Supervised Fine-Tuning Model** trained on labeled data (x, y).
* It provides an initial policy by learning from human-generated responses.
* Helps bootstrap the model before applying reinforcement learning.

---

### 3. **Policy LM (Ï€^RL)**

* The **Policy Language Model** after reinforcement learning updates.
* It optimizes for responses that yield higher rewards by interacting with users or simulated environments.
* Updated using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization).

---

### 4. **Policy LM (Ï€^RL\_old)**

* The previous version of the policy before the current update.
* Used to calculate how much the new policy has diverged during training (via PPO-clip loss).

---

### 5. **Reward Model (r(x, y))**

* Estimates how good a response is given an input query.
* Trained using human preference data or labels.
* Outputs a scalar reward signal that guides learning.

---

### 6. **Value Model (V(s\_t))**

* Predicts the expected future reward from the current state $s_t$.
* Used to reduce variance and stabilize training.
* Updated using mean squared error (MSE loss).

---

### 7. **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**

* Combines reward signals and value predictions to compute advantage:

  $$
  \hat{A}(s_t, a_t) = \sum (\gamma^l \delta_{t+l})
  $$

  Where:

  * $\delta_t = r(s_t, a_t) + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$
  * Helps balance bias and variance in gradient estimation.

---

### 8. **Experience Buffer**

* Stores tuples $(s_t, a_t, \hat{A}(s_t, a_t), \hat{R}_t)$ from interactions.
* Used to update the policy and value networks.

---

### 9. **KL Divergence (KL div)**

* Measures how much the new policy deviates from the initial SFT policy.
* Regularizes the training to prevent drastic shifts in behavior.

---

### 10. **PPO-clip Loss**

* A reinforcement learning objective that clips large policy updates.
* Ensures training stability by controlling how much the policy changes in each step.

---

### 11. **LM Loss**

* The language modeling loss used during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning.
* Encourages the model to predict the next token accurately.

---

### 12. **MSE Loss (Mean Squared Error)**

* Used to train the value model by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual rewards.

---

### 13. **Return (R\_t)**

* The cumulative reward over a sequence of steps.
* Combines immediate rewards and future expected rewards.

$$
\hat{R}_t = \hat{A}(s_t, a_t) + V(s_t)
$$

---

### 14. **TD Error (Temporal Difference Error)**

* Error signal for updating value predictions based on differences between observed and predicted rewards.

---

## ðŸ“Š **Workflow Summary**

1. The **user query (x)** is input to the system.
2. The **SFT model** provides an initial supervised response.
3. The **reward model** evaluates the responseâ€™s quality.
4. The **value model** estimates expected rewards for states.
5. The **GAE** computes advantages to guide learning.
6. The **experience buffer** stores interactions for training.
7. The **policy model** is updated using PPO to improve based on rewards.
8. The **KL divergence** ensures the model doesnâ€™t drift too far from the original supervised learning.
9. Losses like **LM loss** and **MSE loss** are used to fine-tune the models.

---

## âœ… **Key Takeaways**

* The architecture balances supervised learning and reinforcement learning to produce robust and human-aligned language models.
* **Reward modeling** and **GAE** play crucial roles in learning from feedback while controlling variance.
* **PPO and KL regularization** help maintain training stability.
* This framework is widely used in aligning large language models like GPT or other generative systems with human intent.
