# Enhancing E-commerce Search Relevance with CrossEncoders and LLMs: Optimizing Inference Speed

E-commerce platforms increasingly face the challenge of delivering accurate and relevant search results in real-time while managing vast product catalogs. Traditional search algorithms often struggle with colloquial queries and implicit user intent, leading to suboptimal search experiences. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and CrossEncoders offer promising solutions to enhance search relevance, but their computational intensity introduces performance bottlenecks. This report examines how e-commerce platforms can leverage these technologies while optimizing inference speeds to deliver superior search experiences.

## Understanding Search Relevance Challenges in E-commerce

E-commerce search systems face unique challenges compared to general web search. While traditionally relying on sparse retrieval methods like TF-IDF and BM25, these approaches often fall short when handling colloquial and implicit queries that don't directly match product descriptions[^1_5]. For instance, a query like "What are the best gifts for boys under 5?" might return poor results despite relevant products existing in the catalog. Such limitations directly impact user experience and business metrics, as customers expect fast, accurate search results that match their intent rather than just keyword matching[^1_3].

The fundamental challenge lies in balancing search precision with computational efficiency. Advanced models that deliver higher relevance typically require more computational resources, thereby increasing latency and potentially degrading user experience if not properly optimized[^1_7].

## CrossEncoders vs. Bi-encoders for Search Relevance

The debate between CrossEncoders and bi-encoders highlights the central trade-off in search architecture:

### Bi-encoders (Vector Search)

Bi-encoders compute separate embeddings for queries and documents, allowing for fast similarity computation through efficient indexing methods. These models excel at scale but may sacrifice some degree of contextual understanding[^1_10].

### CrossEncoders

CrossEncoders process query-document pairs jointly through attention mechanisms, enabling richer contextual understanding and more accurate relevance scoring. However, they cannot be pre-computed or indexed efficiently, making them computationally expensive at scale[^1_9][^1_10].

For typical reranking scenarios, cross-encoders (even in zero-shot mode) demonstrate significantly higher precision compared to bi-encoders[^1_4]. This makes them particularly valuable for e-commerce applications where understanding nuanced product relevance is crucial.

## The Inference Speed Challenge

Despite their superior relevance capabilities, CrossEncoders and large LLMs pose significant inference speed challenges:

1. **Computational Intensity**: CrossEncoders require processing each query-document pair separately, making the computational cost scale linearly with the number of documents[^1_9].
2. **Latency Concerns**: In e-commerce, search response times directly impact user experience and conversion rates, with even slight delays potentially causing customer abandonment[^1_3].
3. **Resource Requirements**: Running large language models for search requires substantial computational resources, increasing operational costs[^1_7][^1_11].

## Optimization Strategies for Faster Inference

Several techniques have emerged to address inference speed challenges while maintaining search quality:

### 1. Hybrid Retrieval Architectures

A popular approach combines the efficiency of bi-encoders with the accuracy of CrossEncoders in a two-stage process:

1. **Initial Retrieval**: Use bi-encoders or vector search to efficiently identify top-N candidate documents.
2. **Reranking**: Apply CrossEncoders only to this reduced set to precisely reorder results based on relevance[^1_9].

This hybrid approach significantly reduces computational requirements while maintaining result quality. The cost scales as `(D + Q) * cost of embedding + (N * Q) * cost of re-ranking`, where N is the number of candidates reranked, making it far more efficient than pure CrossEncoder approaches[^1_9].

### 2. Model Compression Techniques

Several model compression techniques can accelerate inference:

- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**: This technique efficiently fine-tunes large models by introducing low-rank matrices that modify specific parameters without retraining the entire model. Researchers have successfully adapted LLAMA2 7B using LoRA for e-commerce sponsored search, achieving 89.43% relevance accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency[^1_1].
- **Quantization**: Reducing the precision of model weights and activations (from 32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers or lower) can dramatically decrease memory requirements and increase inference speed with minimal impact on accuracy[^1_11].
- **Pruning**: Removing less important weights from neural networks can reduce model size and accelerate inference[^1_11].


### 3. Hardware Acceleration

Specialized hardware significantly impacts inference performance:

- **Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)** and **Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)** can dramatically accelerate matrix operations common in LLM inference[^1_7].
- **Batch processing** of multiple search requests rather than processing them individually improves throughput on accelerated hardware[^1_7].


## Novel Approaches for E-commerce Search Relevance

Recent research has introduced specialized approaches for e-commerce search that balance relevance and speed:

### Entity-Based Relevance Models

The Entity-Based Relevance Model (EBRM) decomposes query-item relevance into multiple query-entity relevance problems, then aggregates results using soft logic formulation. This approach:

1. Allows use of CrossEncoders for high accuracy on entity-level relevance
2. Enables caching of query-entity predictions for fast online inference
3. Makes the prediction procedure interpretable and intervenable[^1_6]

### LLM-based Relevance Frameworks

The LLM-based RElevance Framework (LREF) enhances e-commerce search through:

1. Supervised fine-tuning with strategic data selection
2. Multiple Chain of Thought (Multi-CoT) tuning to enhance reasoning
3. Direct Preference Optimization for de-biasing to avoid over-recall[^1_2]

This framework showed significant improvements in both offline metrics and online A/B testing for a major e-commerce application[^1_2].

## Case Studies and Implementation Results

Implementations of these technologies have demonstrated impressive results in production environments:

### Case Study 1: Hybrid Autoregressive Inference

A hybrid framework using bi-encoders achieved performance comparable to state-of-the-art CrossEncoders while being approximately 50 times faster. The model proved scalable to corpora containing millions of facts, demonstrating its suitability for real-world e-commerce applications[^1_8].

### Case Study 2: Sponsored Search Framework

A sponsored search framework using LLAMA2 7B with LoRA adaptation achieved 89.43% accuracy in ad relevance classification—outperforming both baseline models and advanced language models like GPT-4. The integration resulted in enhanced search accuracy, cost efficiency, and operational privacy[^1_1].

### Performance Benchmarks

When comparing inference times, hybrid approaches typically deliver substantial improvements:

- Pure CrossEncoder approaches may take several seconds per query for large document collections
- Hybrid approaches combining vector search with CrossEncoder reranking reduce this to under 1 second
- The SCAR hybrid framework performed inference in less than 1 second per question on corpora containing 1 million facts[^1_8]


## Implementation Best Practices

When implementing CrossEncoders and LLMs for e-commerce search, consider these best practices:

### 1. Two-Stage Architecture

Implement a two-stage architecture where:

- First stage: Use fast vector search to retrieve top candidates (hundreds)
- Second stage: Apply CrossEncoders to rerank only the top results (typically 10-100)[^1_9][^1_10]


### 2. Caching Strategies

Implement strategic caching of:

- Common query-product pair evaluations
- Intermediate representations
- Entity-level relevance scores for decomposed models[^1_6]


### 3. Model Selection and Tuning

- For CrossEncoders, consider starting with pre-trained models like "MS-MARCO MiniLM-L6-v2"[^1_4]
- Adapt models to your specific product catalog using domain-specific fine-tuning[^1_1]
- Consider model size carefully—smaller, specialized models may outperform larger generic models for domain-specific tasks while delivering faster inference[^1_11]


## Future Directions

The field continues to evolve rapidly with several promising directions:

1. **Multimodal Search**: Incorporating image and text understanding for better product search relevance
2. **Personalized Relevance**: Adapting relevance models to individual user preferences and shopping history
3. **Further Compression Techniques**: More efficient model architectures specifically designed for search relevance tasks
4. **Custom Hardware Solutions**: Specialized chips designed specifically for inference optimization

## Conclusion

Enhancing e-commerce search relevance using CrossEncoders and LLMs represents a significant opportunity for improving user experience and business metrics. While these models present inference speed challenges, a combination of hybrid architectures, model optimization techniques, and hardware acceleration can deliver both superior relevance and acceptable performance.

The most successful implementations will likely continue to be hybrid approaches that strategically apply higher-cost models only where they add significant value. As optimization techniques continue to improve, we can expect even larger and more capable models to become practical for real-time e-commerce search applications, further enhancing the accuracy and naturalness of search experiences.
