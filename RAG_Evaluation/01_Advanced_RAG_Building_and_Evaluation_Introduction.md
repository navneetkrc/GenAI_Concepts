## 🎯 **Why Advanced RAG Matters**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, but to answer questions based on **user-specific data**, you need more than just raw AI power.
**Effective RAG systems**:

✔ Provide highly relevant context

✔ Improve answer generation

✔ Allow efficient iteration during development & maintenance

✔ Require robust evaluation frameworks

---

## 🔍 **Key Challenges**

* ✅ *Retrieval Techniques*: Getting relevant information from large documents
* ✅ *Contextualization*: Giving LLMs coherent and connected content
* ✅ *Evaluation Frameworks*: Tracking performance and improving systematically

---

## 🚀 **Advanced Retrieval Methods**

### 📖 **1. Sentence Window Retrieval**

👉 Retrieves not just the most relevant sentence, but also surrounding sentences to give richer context
**Benefits:**

* More coherent information
* Better understanding by LLMs

---

### 🌳 **2. Auto-Merging Retrieval**

👉 Organizes documents into a tree structure
✅ Relevant child nodes → entire parent node’s content is provided as context
**Benefits:**

* Dynamically captures connected ideas
* Efficient chunking for LLM comprehension

## 📊 **RAG Evaluation: The RAG Triad**

### 1️⃣ **Context Relevance**

Measures how well retrieved text matches the user’s query
✔ Helps debug retrieval issues

### 2️⃣ **Groundedness**

Ensures that the answer is based on actual context and not hallucinated
✔ Increases trustworthiness

### 3️⃣ **Answer Relevance**

Evaluates how well the final answer addresses the question
✔ Drives targeted improvements

---

## 🧩 **Systematic Iteration**

✔ Establish a baseline with experiment tracking

✔ Use evaluation metrics to focus on areas needing improvement

✔ Apply tuning strategies from real-world experiences
