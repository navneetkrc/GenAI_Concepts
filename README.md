# GenAI Concepts - **Key Points**

## Foundation Models

- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
  - Pre-trained on vast text datasets
  - Examples: GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA, Gemini, PaLM
  - Foundation for most text-based AI applications

- **Multimodal Models**
  - Process multiple types of data (text, images, video,audio)
  - Examples: GPT-4V, Claude Opus, Gemini, DALL-E 3

## Key Technical Concepts
